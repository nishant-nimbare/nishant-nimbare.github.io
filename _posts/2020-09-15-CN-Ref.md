# Address Formats
- IPv4 : 32 bits / 4 bytes    
- IPv6 : 128 bits / 16 bytes    
- Mac address : 48 bits / 6 bytes

# DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names.

Steps :-
1. User types ‘example.com’ into a web browser and the query travels into the Internet and is received by a DNS recursive resolver.
2. The resolver then queries a DNS root nameserver (.).
3. The root server then responds to the resolver with the address of a Top Level Domain (TLD) DNS server (such as .com or .net), which stores the information for its domains. When searching for example.com, our request is pointed toward the .com TLD.
4. The resolver then makes a request to the .com TLD.
5. The TLD server then responds with the IP address of the domain’s nameserver, example.com.
6. Lastly, the recursive resolver sends a query to the domain’s nameserver.
7. The IP address for example.com is then returned to the resolver from the nameserver.
8. The DNS resolver then responds to the web browser with the IP address of the domain requested initially.
Once the 8 steps of the DNS lookup have returned the IP address for example.com, the browser is able to make the request for the web page:

9. The browser makes a HTTP request to the IP address.
10. The server at that IP returns the webpage to be rendered in the browser (step 10).

## DNS records

- A – specifies IP addresses corresponding to your domain and its subdomains.
- MX – specifies where the emails for your domain should be delivered.
- CNAME – specifies redirects from your domain’s subdomains to other  domains/subdomains.
- TXT – used to store text-based information related to your domain.  Most commonly used for storing SPF data.
- SPF – a mail validation protocol used to prevent email spoofing.
- AAAA – it maps a domain name to the IP address (IPv6) of the  computer hosting the domain.
- SRV – stands for Service Record and it specifies on only an IP but also a port.


A Canonical Name (CNAME) Record is used in the Domain Name System (DNS) to create an alias from one domain name to another domain name. A common example is the www subdomain which is provided as an alias to the root domain name - users accessing “www.example.com” are referred to the root domain (or DNS zone apex) “example.com”.

An A Record maps a hostname to one or more IP addresses, while the CNAME record maps a hostname to another hostname.


eg:-
```
NAME TYPE VALUE
--------------------------------------------------
old.example.com. CNAME new.example.com.
new.example.com. A 192.162.100.101
