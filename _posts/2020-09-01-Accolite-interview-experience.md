# Sponser Round 

I don't know what sponsor round means, but it is the final round of hiring process.
I asked my friend who already had the offer from ACH but they didn't have this.

I would consider this most diffiult interview i have given till date.
but i would also say that the interviewer  was best one i had till date.

start off by questions about internship project, tech stack used, some specific technologies used ( tokens, cors, etc)

why mongoDB, bottlenecks of using mongo, what primary key and why?

why node, async programming, node event loop.

design question on above project

some more high lvl design questions, design patterns, cohesion coupling. 

the whole interview was based on thinking process and design concepts.

No syntax lvl or DSA questions



ps:i was grinding through dp and graph questions the day before for preparation.
