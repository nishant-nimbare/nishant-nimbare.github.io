This is w.r.t the tcs digital hiring drive 2020 ( __not__ through nqt)

The initial test was taken in 2 phases ( on 2 seperate days). 
- MCQ based ( quants, verbal, logical )  
- Programming test ( 2 questions were given, this was taken on the codevita platfrom ), easy-lvl questions

TCS only takes 1 interview with 3 panelists: a technical guy, a managerial guy and a HR.

Usually the interview goes on for around an hour or so. but my interview lasted only 25 mins. 
I don't exaclty know the reason why, but I suspect I was the last candidate of that panel so they rushed it  maybe xp.


- Questions on android : 
Android lifecycle methods.
can we have an android app without and icon in app drawer.
